Learning how to setup webpack and server
In this study project, we will be focusing on learning JavaScript before diving into libraries. We will cover various topics such as setting up webpack and a server, using Babel for transpiling, understanding bundling concepts, exploring JavaScript in-depth including iterators, capturing and treating events, as well as making API requests using fetch and saving data.

To get started, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Then, follow the steps below to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hair_day.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd hair_day
```

3. Install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:
```
npm start
```

This will start the webpack-dev-server and you can access your project at `http://localhost:3000`.

Feel free to explore the codebase and make changes as you learn. Remember to commit your changes regularly and push them to your GitHub repository.

Happy coding!
